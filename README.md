This is my very first repo where I have GIT setup learning is not always in a book can be practical and need to be applied before consumation. 

You're doing great!! Keep learning this is for you not for the job or your career. THis is so you can enjoy some learning without having to make money from the skills you acquire. 

Enjoy the journey here stop trying to be perfect and enjo ythe mistakes you make. Laugh at yourself and be kind when talking yourself. God is good!!!
